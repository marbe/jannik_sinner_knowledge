## Overview
Jannik Sinner (born 16 August 2001) is an Italian professional tennis player. He has been ranked as high as world No. 2 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), and is the highest-ranked Italian tennis player in history. Sinner has won 13 ATP Tour singles titles, including a Grand Slam title at the 2024 Australian Open and two Masters 1000 titles. He has reached the semifinals at Wimbledon as well as the quarterfinals of the French Open and US Open. At the end of the 2023 season, Sinner was runner-up at the ATP Finals and led Italy to the Davis Cup crown.

Sinner also has a career-high ranking of world No. 124 in doubles, achieved in September 2021, and has won one ATP Tour title in doubles.

Sinner grew up in northern Italy in the predominantly German-speaking region of South Tyrol. He was active in sports such as skiing, football, and tennis as a child. After being a competitive skier between the ages of 8-12, Sinner switched to focus exclusively on tennis at age 13 and moved to Bordighera on the Italian Riviera to train with veteran coach Riccardo Piatti. Despite limited success as a junior, Sinner began playing in professional men's events at age 16 and became one of the few players to win multiple ATP Challenger Tour titles at age 17. In 2019, he broke into the top 100, winning the Next Generation ATP Finals and the ATP Newcomer of the Year award.

Sinner continued his rise into the top 50 in 2020 with his first top 10 victory, a French Open quarterfinal, and his first ATP Tour title at the 2020 Sofia Open. In 2021, he became the youngest ATP 500 champion at the 2021 Citi Open, was a Masters runner-up at the Miami Open, and became the first player born in the 2000s to enter the top 10 in rankings. After reaching his first major semifinal at the 2023 Wimbledon Championships, Sinner won his first Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Canadian Open. He finished the season by reaching the final of the ATP Finals and contributed to Italy lifting the Davis Cup for the first time since 1976. In the 2024 Australian Open, Sinner defeated world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the semifinals to reach his first major final. He then defeated Daniil Medvedev in a five-set final, coming back from two sets down to win his first Grand Slam title.

## Early life and background
Jannik Sinner was born 16 August 2001 to Hanspeter and Siglinde Sinner in Innichen in the province of South Tyrol in Northern Italy. His mother tongue is German. He grew up in the town of Sexten in the Dolomites, the family hometown, where his father and mother work as a chef and a waitress at a ski lodge, respectively. He has a brother named Marc. Sinner began both skiing and playing tennis at age three. He was one of Italy's top junior skiers from eight to twelve years old, winning a national championship in giant slalom at age eight and earning a national runner-up at the age of twelve.

While training in skiing Sinner gave up tennis for a year at the age of seven before his father pushed him to return to the sport. When he resumed playing, he began working with Heribert Mayr as his first regular coach. Nonetheless, tennis was still only his third priority behind skiing and football.

At the age of 13 Sinner decided to give up skiing and football in favour of tennis. He preferred it over skiing because he wanted to compete directly against an opponent and to have more margin of error over the course of an entire match. He also wanted to be in an individual sport where he could make all of the decisions, an opportunity he would not have in a team sport like football. He decided to move on his own to Bordighera in Liguria on the Italian Riviera to train at the Piatti Tennis Centre under Riccardo Piatti and Massimo Sartori, a decision which his parents supported. At the centre, Sinner lived with the family of Luka Cvjetković, one of his coaches. Before Sinner began training in tennis full-time with Piatti, he had been playing only twice a week.

## Junior career
Sinner began playing on the ITF Junior Circuit, the premier junior tour which is run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), in 2016. Despite having limited success as a junior, he moved mainly to the professional tour following the end of 2017. He never played the main draw of any high-level Grade 1 events in singles, and the only higher-level Grade A tournament he entered was the Trofeo Bonfiglio. He followed up an opening round loss at Italy's Grade A tournament in 2017 with a quarterfinal in 2018. That was the only junior event he played in 2018. He never played any of the junior Grand Slam tournaments. Because he entered so few high-level tournaments, Sinner's career-high junior ranking was a relatively low No. 133.

## Professional career
### 2018: ITF Futures and Challenger Tour
Sinner began playing on the ITF Men's Circuit in early 2018. With his low ranking he could initially be directly accepted into only ITF Futures events. Nonetheless, he began receiving wild cards for ATP Challenger Tour events, the second-tier tour run by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), in the second half of the year. His only ITF title of the year was in doubles, and he finished the season ranked No. 551.

### 2019: NextGen Finals title and top 100

Sinner at the 2019 Next Generation ATP Finals in Milan
Sinner won his first ATP Challenger title in Bergamo in February 2019 at the age of 17 years and 6 months, despite entering the tournament with no match wins at the Challenger level. He became the first person born in 2001 to reach a Challenger final, and the youngest Italian to win a Challenger title in history. With the title, he rose over 200 spots in ATP rankings up to No. 324. After his first two ITF Futures titles, Sinner entered his first ATP tournament at the Hungarian Open as a lucky loser, where he notched his first tour-level win over home wild card Máté Valkusz. The next week, he reached his second ATP Challenger final in Ostrava, finishing runner-up to Kamil Majchrzak.

During the second half of the season Sinner played more often on the ATP Tour than the Challenger Tour. His first ATP Masters victory came at the Italian Open against Steve Johnson, and he broke into the top 200 with his next ATP win at the Croatia Open Umag in July. The next month, he won a second ATP Challenger title in Lexington to become one of just eleven 17-year-olds to have won multiple Challenger titles. After losing in qualifying at Wimbledon, Sinner qualified for his first Grand Slam main draw at the US Open. He lost his debut match to No. 24 Stan Wawrinka.

Sinner had a strong finish to the season. As a wild card at the European Open, he became the youngest player in five years to reach an ATP semifinal. Along the way, he knocked off top seed and world No. 13 Gaël Monfils for his first career top 50 victory. This performance helped him break into the top 100 for the first time one week later. At the end of the season, Sinner qualified for the 2019 Next Gen ATP Finals as the Italian wild card and the lowest seed. He won in his round robin group with victories over Frances Tiafoe and Mikael Ymer, losing only to Ugo Humbert. After defeating Miomir Kecmanović in the semifinals, Sinner upset top seed and world No. 18 Alex de Minaur in straight sets to win the title. He played one last event in Italy the following week, winning a third Challenger title in Ortisei. Sinner finished the year at world No. 78, becoming the youngest player in the year-end top 80 since Rafael Nadal in 2003. He was also named ATP Newcomer of the Year.

As a wild card at the Rotterdam Open, he earned his first top 10 victory against world No. 10 David Goffin.

Following the ATP Tour shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sinner had a successful restart to the season. Although he lost his opening round match to Karen Khachanov at the US Open, he fared better in Europe. He reached the third round at the Rome Masters, highlighted by a victory over world No. 6 Stefanos Tsitsipas. He then progressed to become the youngest quarterfinalist at the French Open since Novak Djokovic in 2006, and the first to make the quarterfinals on debut since Rafael Nadal in 2005. During the tournament, he defeated Goffin again as well as US Open runner-up and world No. 7 Alexander Zverev before losing to Nadal.

After a semifinal at the Cologne Championship where he lost to Zverev, Sinner closed out the season by winning the Sofia Open for his first ATP title. During the event, he defeated Next Gen rival Alex de Minaur and then Vasek Pospisil in the final. He became the youngest Italian tour-level champion in the Open Era and the youngest player overall to win an ATP title since Kei Nishikori in 2008.

Sinner finished the year ranked world No. 37.

He became the youngest to win back-to-back ATP titles since Rafael Nadal in 2005. His ten-match winning streak came to an end in the first round of the 2021 Australian Open, where he lost a tight five-set match to world No. 12 Denis Shapovalov.

Sinner's next big result was at the Miami Open, where he reached his first ATP Masters 1000 final. During the tournament, he defeated Khachanov again and later world No. 12 Roberto Bautista Agut in the semifinal. He finished runner-up to Hubert Hurkacz.

At the Rolex Paris Masters, Sinner received a bye in the first round but was defeated by Carlos Alcaraz. Because of this, Sinner was unable to directly qualify for the season-ending Nitto ATP Finals.

At the ATP Finals in Turin, Sinner was present as the first alternate. Sinner entered the tournament after countryman Matteo Berrettini was forced to withdraw with an abdominal injury after his first match with Alexander Zverev. He defeated Hubert Hurkacz and became the youngest player to win an ATP Finals match on debut since Lleyton Hewitt in Lisbon in 2000 and the first alternate to win a match since Janko Tipsarević in London in 2011. Sinner played Daniil Medvedev next in the round robin stage, holding a match point before being defeated in 3 sets.

Main article: 2024 Jannik Sinner tennis season
Sinner started his year at the Australian Open, where he beat Botic van de Zandschulp, Jesper de Jong, Sebastián Báez, Karen Khachanov and Andrey Rublev (all in straight sets) to reach his second semifinal and first at the Australian Open. In the semifinals, he upset world no. 1 and defending champion Novak Djokovic to advance to his first major final, becoming the first player not to face a break point against Djokovic in a completed major match. His victory over the world No. 1 was Djokovic's first defeat at the Australian Open since 2018. He became the first Italian player to reach the singles final at this major and the third man, after Adriano Panatta at the 1976 French Open and Matteo Berrettini at the 2021 Wimbledon Championships, to reach a major final in the Open Era. In the final, he came from a two-set deficit to beat Daniil Medvedev to become the first Italian player, male or female, to win the Australian Open singles title, and the third man to win a Major (the second of which in the Open Era), and the first in 48 years. His victory over Medvedev meant he became the second player to win the Australian Open after losing the first two sets in the final, after Rafael Nadal, who also beat Medvedev in 2022.

As the top seed at the Rotterdam Open, he recorded his 200th win in the quarterfinals, after Milos Raonic retired with a hip injury with Sinner leading by a set, becoming the first player born in the 2000s to accomplish this feat. After defeating Tallon Griekspoor in the semifinal and Alex de Minaur in the final, Sinner rose to a new career high of No. 3 in the world, becoming the highest-ranked Italian player in history. Sinner also became the first male player since Lleyton Hewitt, in 2001, to win his debut event as Grand Slam champion. At the 2024 BNP Paribas Open, with a victory over 25th seed Jan-Lennard Struff to reach the fourth round, he recorded his 17th consecutive match win, the longest ATP level streak for an Italian player in the Open Era. Sinner extended this to 19 consecutive wins (16-0 in 2024) by defeating Jiří Lehečka in the quarterfinal. Prior to his semifinal defeat to Carlos Alcaraz, Sinner had won 36 of his past 38 matches, dating back to the 2023 China Open.

In March, Sinner played in Indian Wells singles where he defeated Thanasi Kokkinakis, Jan-Lennard Struff, Ben Shelton, and Jiří Lehečka all in straight sets to advance to the semi finals. In the semi finals, he faced Carlos Alcaraz and lost in a three-set match. He also played in Indian Wells doubles with Lorenzo Sonego where they defeated Karen Khachanov and Andrey Rublev in the first round in straight sets. In the second round, they lost to Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos in straight sets.

At the 2024 Miami Open, Sinner defeated Grigor Dimitrov in the final to win his second Master’s 1000 title; as a result, he climbed to a career high (and Italian record) ranking of No. 2 in the world. Sinner improved his 2024 ATP match record to 22–1.

## Playing style
Sinner is an aggressive baseliner and is one of the hardest hitters on the ATP tour. Sinner's groundstroke strength is his two-handed-backhand, which he hits with more topspin than any other player on the tour, registering an average of 1858 revolutions per minute on the shot along with the fifth-best average speed of 111.2 km/h (69.1 mph). His forehand is also a strength, owing to the fact he has a short compact takeback, meaning he rarely has to rush the shot, and the ability to rapidly open up his body, generating huge racket head speed and allowing him to hit the shot at over 160 km/h (100 mph) on occasion. He uses a modern, semi-western grip to generate large amounts of topspin, increasing net clearance and reducing the likelihood of unforced errors.

He also possesses a powerful first serve, which can reach up to speeds of 221 km/h (137.3 mph) although it has been criticised for its low average in percentage at 59.2%. His coaching team has tried to combat this by alternating between the pinpoint (legs together) and platform (legs apart) stances, although as of late 2023 it seems they have settled on the pinpoint stance. Sinner is aiming to incorporate more variety into his game, hence he has been developing his net game and ability to serve-and-volley, as well as his slices and dropshots, to reduce the number of long rallies he has to play from the baseline.

Sinner has been compared to Roger Federer for his calm on-court demeanour and all-court movement. Federer himself has praised Sinner for the balance in his game, remarking, "What I like about him is that he almost has the same speed of shooting from the forehand and backhand". Former world No. 1 junior and tennis coach Claudio Pistolesi has praised Sinner's good lateral movement, which he attributes in part to Sinner's background in skiing. In this regard, Sinner has been compared to Novak Djokovic, who also credits a background in skiing for improving his tennis skills.

## Coaches
When Sinner began to prioritise tennis at age thirteen, he was coached by Riccardo Piatti, who had also been a part-time coach of Novak Djokovic and Milos Raonic. At the time, he also began working with Andrea Volpini and Massimo Sartori, the latter of whom was a longtime coach of Andreas Seppi. He continued to work with Piatti as his primary coach, and Volpini as his second coach. His team also consisted of physiotherapist Claudio Zimaglia and fitness coach Dalibor Sirola.

In February 2022, he decided to stop his long collaboration with Piatti and his team and began to train with Simone Vagnozzi, ex-coach of Marco Cecchinato. In July 2022, coach Darren Cahill officially joined Sinner's team.

## Personal life
Sinner grew up in a German-speaking family. His Italian greatly improved after moving to Bordighera at the age of 13, and he also speaks English.

Sinner resides in Monte Carlo in Monaco. He is a fan of the football club AC Milan. One of his tennis idols is compatriot Andreas Seppi, who is also from South Tyrol. Aged 17, Sinner stated that one of his goals was to "do better than him [Seppi]". He also idolized Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic.

Sinner follows a healthy diet and conservative lifestyle. He enjoys cars.

He is currently dating fellow tennis player Anna Kalinskaya.
